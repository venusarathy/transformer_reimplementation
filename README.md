# Transformer Reimplementation ("Attention is All You Need")

This repository is a PyTorch reimplementation of the "Attention is All You Need" paper, including a transformer model for NLP tasks. This example trains the model on the IMDb dataset using TensorFlow Datasets for preprocessing.

## Structure
- `models/`: Contains the transformer model and embedding code.
- `training/`: Contains the training scripts.
- `data/`: Code to load and preprocess datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
- `checkpoints/`: Directory to save model checkpoints.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
